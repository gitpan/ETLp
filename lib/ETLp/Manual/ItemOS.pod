=head1 ITERATIVE AND SERIAL OS ITEMS

The OS plugin provides the ability to operating system commands.

The item parameters are:

=over 4

=item * B<name>. The name of this item

=item * B<command>. The OS command being run

=item * B<timeout>. Timeout (in seconds) after which the job is cancelled. Defaults to 0 (No timeout)

=item * B<hide_command>. Record the raw command in the audit records, so that potentially sensitive information is not interpolated. Defaults to 0 (not interpolated).

=item * on_error. Override the setting for the job. See L<ETLp::Manual::Index> for a detailed explanation of this parameter.

    <item>
        name         = get file
        type         = os
        command      = %app_root%/bin/ftp_sales.pl 
        timeout      = 60
    </item>

Iterative items also have access to iterative placeholders:


    <item>
        name         = move file
        type         = os
        command      = mv %filename% %archive_dir%
        timeout      = 60
    </item>
