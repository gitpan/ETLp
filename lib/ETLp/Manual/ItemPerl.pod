=head1 ITERATIVE AND SERIAL PERL ITEMS

The Perl plugin allows packaged Perl subroutines to be called.

=over 4

=item * B<name>. The name of this item.

=item * B<package>. The name of the Perl package. It must be in the library path. If the job is invoked by the e''''tlp command, %app_root%/lib will be in the path.

=item * B<sub>. The subroutine being called.

=item * B<parameters>. Text that will be eval'd as part of the subroutine invocation.

=item * B<on_error>. Override the setting for the job. See See L<ETLp::Manual::Index> for a detailed explanation of this parameter.

=head2 Example

    <item>
        name     = rename files
        type     = perl
        package  = MyApp::ProcesFiles
        sub      = add_suffix
        params   = app_root => '%app_root%', \
                   filename => '%filename%', \
                   suffix   => '_bak'
    </item>

Note, only iterative jobs can use iterative placeholders like I<%filename%>.
